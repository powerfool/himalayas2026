I want to plan a trip to the Indian Himalayas with motorbikes with a friend of mine. I am currently in the research and planning phase. I have found some itineraries from tour operators in the area. My first job is to try to understand the different routes and the places that they pass from, what kind of villages are on the way, stops, support, accommodation and so on and so forth. So basically I want to create a kind of like, at the beginning a local web app that I can use to build this kind of intelligence while I'm performing the research and maybe later this could be all hosted in the cloud so it can serve as my companion throughout the trip or host important information for the trip that I can take with me using for example offline mode on the phone. We'll see about that later. For now, as a first step I would like to first visualize the routes. So I would like to have an interface where I can input, let's say the name of the route and then copy paste the itinerary as it's described in the tour operators website and see how this itinerary looks like on the map. So maybe create a mapping interface using OpenStreetMap for example. And OpenRouteService to create the routes between different waypoints. So yeah, let's start with the plan for that and we can move forward later.
About the technology of the platform, you should know that I'm completely clueless about coding, so this is all going to be vibe-coded. I would prefer to use a technology stack that is very easily maintainable and easy to correct should issues come up. So, this is completely up to you if you're going to go with React or something based on Python.
Since this is going to be an iterative process over many months, I mean this kind of research is going to be evolving over many months, I would like to be able to have storage and persistent storage that I can go back to every time I open the app. So, it's not enough to do everything on the fly when I paste the itineraries. It's something that should have storage and allow gradual continuous working on itineraries and making changes or testing something new. So, for example, in the future I'm going to ask you that I am able to insert a different itinerary and maybe be able to visualize both of them at the same time and so on. So, this should better be developed as an application that I can open and use over time rather than static web page.

**Current state (as built):** Storage is implemented with browser IndexedDB: routes persist in that browser only (no file in the project folder). Opening the app in another browser or device does not show the same routes. For cloud hosting and an online database so routes are available everywhere, see the Deployment section in README.md.
