Get ready, have breakfast, and hit the road. Ride towards Khardung La (18380 Feet). The view from top of the pass is amazing. One can see all the way south over the Indus valley to the seemingly endless peaks. This ride till top of Khardung La is just mesmerizing. Beautiful views all around. After spending some time at the pass, we’ll head towards Nubra Valley.
Day 4
Nubra to Pangong Tso :
Roads parallel to Shyok River towards world famous lake Pangong-Tso. The beauty of Pangong is well known and it is a must visit when you are riding in Ladakh. Simply amazing views of both mountains and lake together.

The route is full of adventure and there are some good off-road patches. The sand patches in Himalayas are going to be challenging and test your riding skills. The views are breathtaking. In evening we will witness sunset behind the golden mountains of Pangong.
Day 5
Pangong to Hanle :
Get ready to hit the unexplored road towards Hanle. Less explored is where we thrive. This is our forte and we are sure that you will love exploring this new region with us.

The ride will continue along the Pangong Lake. We will be covering complete length of Pangong Tso during this ride. The sudden change in terrain is exciting. The shades of mountains in this region stand out and you cannot get enough of these colourful beauty!
Day 6
Hanle to Umling La and back :
Post breakfast we will start our ride. This is a very important day of the ride as we will be riding to the Undoubtable Highest Motorable pass- Umling La which is at 19300 feet making it higher than Khardung La.

Overnight stay at Hanle.
Day 7
Hanle to Tsomoriri :
We will take an adventurous road on this day!

On this day, we will be witnessing beauty of two very rarely visited lakes namely, Rayul Tso & Chilling Tso!

Another route is the usual one. You will see the different colors of mountains, wild horses & scenery like wall paintings. The beauty of the place changes once we take left turn from Mahe Bridge. The last 25kms of ride is boon for off-road lovers. This route is very scenic & good place to experience plateaus in Himalayas.
Tsomoriri is not as big as Pangong Tso but it has its own charm & beauty to experience it. It’s a sweet water lake.
Day 8
Tsomoriri- Tsokar (Salt Lake)- More Plains- Leh :
On the way to Tso Kar witness huge Phosphorus Mountains. The roads are very lonely yet scenic enough to sooth your eyes. It is hard to believe that Tso Kar is Salt Lake in the Himalayas as Pangong Tso. Visit Tsokar, here you will spot lots of wild animals like Tibetan wild ass, rare black-necked crane, Mormot etc.

We will continue our journey from the famous Moore Plains. Situated in a plateau, it is a relatively flat piece of land located at the altitude of 15,400ft. This is one of the amazing sights to watch. We will make a stop to click photographs of these plains. Make the most of it, you can get some really nice shots here.
Roads to Tanglangla is icing on cake. This is one of the most comfortable journeys towards another high pass Tanglang-La. Overnight stay in Leh. This will be your last night in Leh.
